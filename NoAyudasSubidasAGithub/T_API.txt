		- 1️ Basic Auth
		
			It is the simplest form of API authentication that uses a username and password to access the API.
			
			However, it is not secure, as the username and password are sent in plain text.
		
		- 2️ API Keys
		
			They are unique keys generated by the API provider to authenticate and authorize API requests.
			
			It is easy to implement but can be compromised if shared or intercepted.
		
		- 3️ OAuth 2.0
		
			A protocol that enables delegated access to resources without sharing credentials.
			
			It uses tokens that expire and are refreshed after a certain period, providing better security.
		
		
		- 4️ JSON Web Tokens
		
			It is a standard for creating secure access tokens that can be used for authentication and authorization.
			
			It is self-contained and can carry information about the user, reducing the need for frequent database lookups.
			
		- 5️ Header API Authentication

			Header authentication lets API providers require API consumers to add one or more authentication-related headers to API requests.
