				- Netlify Build Image
					- https://github.com/netlify/build-image#running-locally
					
						- Running locally
							- Emulating Netlify's buildbot on your local machine requires the following:

								- Docker
								- A local clone of this build-image repository
								- A local clone of the site repository you want to test, checked out to the branch you want to be built, with a clean git status (nothing to commit).
								
						- Step 1: Pull the build image
							- Open your Docker terminal, and run the following command to pull the default image:
								docker pull netlify/build:focal
								or
								docker pull netlify/build:v3.0.2 # replace the version with a git tag of the specific version you want to test
								
						- Step 2: Start the script to run interactively
							- Still in your Docker terminal, change directories into your local clone of this build-image repository.
							  If you pulled an alternate image in Step 1, check out the corresponding branch in this repository.
							  Run the following command to start the interactive shell within the container:
							  
								./test-tools/start-image.sh path/to/site/repo
								
								If you receive a command not found message, make sure you are in the base of the build-image repository.
								If the command works correctly, you should see a new prompt, with the user buildbot.
								
						- Step 3: Have the buildbot run your build command
							- In the buildbot shell, run build followed by your site build command. For example, for a site build command of npm run build, you would run the following:
							
								/opt/build-bin/build npm run build
								This will run the build as it would run on Netlify, displaying logs in your terminal as it goes. When you are done testing, you can exit the buildbot shell by typing exit.
								
								
steps:
- on Sites press "add new site" botton
- select "import an existing project" option
- press "github" button
- choose "Byron2016/019__FM_000" project
	- owner: Byron2016's team
	- Branch to deploy: 001_cards
	- Build command: npm run build
	- Publish directory: public
- press "Deploy site" botton

it is generated an error.

Production: test_netlify_0...@HEAD Failed.

I already tried:
	- button "Retry - clear chache and retry with latest branch commit"
